# Xenia Canary

## Setup with LaunchBox

 1. Open LaunchBox
 2. Go to **Tools -> Manage... -> Emulators**
 3. Click **Add** to add an emulator. Application Path doesn't have to point to real application. It's enough to just input:
    * **xenia-canary.exe**
    * **/random_path/xenia-canary.exe**
    * **xeniacanary.exe**
    * **/random_path/xeniacanary.exe**

 4. Click **Associated Platforms**, and make sure "Default Emulator" checkbox is checked for platforms which should be started with Xenia Canary. If "Default Emulator" is not checked, then RetroArch is used instead.
