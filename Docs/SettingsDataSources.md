## Advanced Setup - Multiple Data Sources

RetroPass can be configured with more than one LaunchBox or EmulationStation data source. Here are a few example scenarios where you might find this setup useful:
* You would like to connect two or more external storages. You have one USB stick that doesn't have enough free space and contains only a subset of your games. You also have a larger SSD where you keep the rest of your game collection.
* You have a single SSD where you keep all your games. You would like to separate those into two data sources. One data source contains all your games and another one only games which are appropriate for players of all ages.
