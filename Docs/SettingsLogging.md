# Settings - Logging

![](/Docs/settings_log.png)

1. Go to Settings -> Logging and check **Enable Logging**.
2. Quit RetroPass and start it again.
3. Go to Settings -> Logging.
4. View log, scroll up and down and notice yellow warning and red error log entries.
5. Log file is also generated in the local RetroPass folder on Xbox which you can access through Xbox Device Portal.

Make sure to **turn off** logging after troubleshooting, because writing to a log file slows down app performance.
