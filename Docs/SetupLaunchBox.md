# Setup with LaunchBox

1. **IMPORTANT!!!** Install LaunchBox **directly to external storage**. If you install LaunchBox to a folder on your PC instead and then move it to external storage, configuration will be invalid and you'll get an empty library in RetroPass.
1. Configure any of the following emulators in LaunchBox:
    - [RetroArch](/Docs/SetupRetroArch.md)
    - [RetriX Gold](/Docs/SetupRetriXGold.md)  
    - [Dolphin](/Docs/SetupDolphin.md)
    - [XBSX2](/Docs/SetupXBSX2.md)
    - [Xenia Canary](/Docs/SetupXeniaCanary.md)
    - [PPSSPP](/Docs/SetupPPSSPP.md)
1. [Import games](/Docs/SetupLaunchBoxImport.md).
1. If you want to specify the order of your playlists, platforms and games, you can do so by checking the [LaunchBox playlists, platforms and games sorting](/Docs/SetupLaunchBoxSorting.md) section.
1. At this point setup is finished. Connect external storage to Xbox and start RetroPass. Follow [Add DataSource](/Docs/SettingsDataSources.md) section.
