# PPSSPP

## Setup with LaunchBox

 1. Open LaunchBox
 2. Go to **Tools -> Manage... -> Emulators**
 3. Click **Add** to add an emulator. Application Path doesn't have to point to real application. It's enough to just input **ppsspp**.

 4. Click **Associated Platforms**, and make sure "Default Emulator" checkbox is checked for platforms which should be started with PPSPP. If "Default Emulator" is not checked, then RetroArch is used instead.
