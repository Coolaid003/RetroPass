# LaunchBox playlist and platform sorting

If you wish to override default alphabetic sorting of platforms and playlists, provide **Sort Title** parameter. For example, in the following screenshots:
- **Pinball** playlist **Sort Title** is set to **1**
- **Nintendo Entertainment System** platform **Sort Title** is set to **2**  
  
When imported in RetroPass, **Pinball** is shown first, **Nintendo Entertainment System** second, followed by all the other playlists and platforms shown in alphabetical order. For example, if **Pinball** playlist **Sort Title** is set to **B_Pinball**, it is sorted with other playlists that start with the letter **B**.
