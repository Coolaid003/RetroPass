# LaunchBox playlists, platforms and games sorting

## Playlists and platforms sorting

If you wish to override default alphabetic sorting of **platforms and playlists**, provide **Sort Title** parameter. For example, in the following screenshots:
- **Pinball** playlist **Sort Title** is set to **1**
- **Nintendo Entertainment System** platform **Sort Title** is set to **2**  
  
When imported in RetroPass, **Pinball** is shown first, **Nintendo Entertainment System** second, followed by all the other playlists and platforms shown in alphabetical order. For example, if **Pinball** playlist **Sort Title** is set to **B_Pinball**, it is sorted with other playlists that start with the letter **B**.

## Games sorting
If you wish to override default alphabetic sorting of **games** within a platform playlist, provide **Sort Title** parameter in **Edit Game** dialog. For example:
- **Lotus Turbo Challenge 2** in **Amiga** platform playlist normally shows under games starting with L letter. Setting **Sort Title** to **000_Lotus_Turbo_Challenge_2** will show it as first or one of the first games in the **Amiga** platform playlist.
