1. **IMPORTANT!!!** When importing your games, LaunchBox asks you to select which media type to download. If you are using LaunchBox just to configure RetroPass, there is no need to download all the media types because RetroPass needs only a subset. It will speed up your setup process and it will make less burden on LaunchBox database. You only need to check these media types:
    - "Box - Front" 
    - "Screenshot - Game Title"
    - "Screenshot - Gameplay"
    - "Screenshot - Game Select"
    - "Video"
